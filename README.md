# ðŸ§ª Register API Test Automation

This project showcases API test automation using **Java**, **RestAssured**, **Cucumber**, and **Allure Reports**.  
It's built as part of a QA Automation Engineer task to demonstrate test design, code structure, and reporting â€” even when the API itself is read-only.

## ðŸ“Œ About the API

The `/register` endpoint is a **mock AWS service**:
- No write permission
- Always returns `"Internal server error"`
- The goal is to **demonstrate correct implementation**, not actual success/fail responses.

Defined in `register.feature`:
